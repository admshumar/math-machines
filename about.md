I'm Jon Middleton. I love solving problems, doing mathematics, talking about machine learning, and programming.

I use deep learning for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. As of now I'm freelancing, but I would be interested in joining an organization with great people and a cool mission.

I hold postgraduate degrees (M.A. and C.Phil) in pure mathematics from the University of California, San Diego. I did research there, applying the representation theory of semi-simple Lie groups to optimization problems in conformal geometry.

My most recent experience was the [Insight Artificial Intelligence Fellows Program](https://www.insightdata.ai/) in New York City, an intensive seven-week immersion into the local data science scene. Insight is a *pre-start-up* experience, in which participants develop data science software in an agile environment; give demonstrations of minimum viable data science products to companies; and lecture about algorithms, data structures, and software engineering practices. While at Insight, I developed an [open-source deep learning pipeline](https://github.com/admshumar/insight-face-erase) for obscuring human faces in visual media.

Before Insight, I worked at the [International Dual Career Network](http://www.idcn.info/), where I wrangled and visualized the Copenhagen membership database to produce insights about its members' desired job placements in Denmark.

Prior to IDCN, I taught statistics, calculus, and linear algebra at San Diego Mesa College and Southwestern College.
